**Prysm mainnet ETH2.0 Beacon chain + validator**

Validate with prysm: a Go implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 Serenity protocol and open source project created by Prysmatic Labs. Beacon node which powers the beacon chain at the core of Ethereum 2.0

### Staking on Mainnet

To participate in staking, you can join the [official eth2 launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org). The launchpad is the only recommended way to become a validator on mainnet. You can visualize the nodes in the network on [eth2stats.io](https://eth2stats.io), explore validator rewards/penalties via Bitfly's block explorer: [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in), and follow the latest blocks added to the chain on [beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com).
